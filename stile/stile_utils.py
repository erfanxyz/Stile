def FormatArray(d, fields=None):
    """
    Turn a regular NumPy array of arbitrary types into a formatted array, with optional field name
    description.

    This function uses the dtype that the array ``d`` comes with.  This means that arrays of
    heterogeneous objects may not return the dtype you expect (for example, ``int``s will be
    converted to ``float``s if there are floats in the array, or all numbers will be converted to
    strings if there are any strings in the array).  Predefining the format or using a function like
    ``numpy.genfromtxt()`` will prevent these issues, as will reading from a FITS file.

    :param d:      A NumPy array.
    :param fields: A dictionary whose keys are the names of the fields you'd like for the output
                   array, and whose values are field numbers (starting with 0) whose names those
                   keys should replace (or, if the array is already formatted, the existing field
                   names the keys should replace); alternately, a list with the same length as the
                   rows of ``d``. [default: None]
    :returns:      A formatted numpy array with the same shape as ``d`` except that the innermost
                   dimension has turned into a record field if it was not already one, optionally
                   with field names appropriately replaced.
