class DataHandler:
    """
    A class which contains information about the data set Stile is to be run on.  This is used for
    the default drivers, not necessarily the pipeline-specific drivers (such as HSC/LSST).

    The class needs to be able to do two things:
      * List some data given a set of requirements (:func:`DataHandler.listData`).  The
        requirements generally follow the form:

         * object_types: a list of strings such as ``"star"``, ``"PSF star"``, ``"galaxy"`` or
              ``"galaxy random"`` describing the objects that are needed for the tests.
         * epoch: whether this is a single/summary catalog, or a multiepoch time series. (Coadded
              catalogs with no per-epoch information count as a single/summary catalog!)
         * extent: ``"CCD"``, ``"field"``, ``"patch"`` or ``"tract"``.  This can be ignored if you
              don't mind running some extra inappropriate tests!  ``"CCD"`` should be a CCD-type
              dataset, ``"field"`` a single pointing/field-of-view, ``"patch"`` an intermediate-size
              area, and ``"tract"`` a large area.  (These terms have specific meanings in the LSST
              pipeline, but are used for convenience here.)
         * data_format: ``"image"`` or ``"catalog"``.  Right now no image-level tests are
              implemented but we request this kwarg for future development.

      * Take each element of the data list from :func:`DataHandler.listData` and retrieve it for use
        (:func:`DataHandler.getData`), optionally with bins defined.  (Bins can also be defined on a
        test-by-test basis, depending on which format makes the most sense for your data setup.)

      Additionally, the class can define a ``.getOutputPath()`` function to place the data in a more
      complex system than the default (all in one directory with long output path names).

        of either of those things.

        If it's a tuple ``(file_name, field_schema)``, the assumption is that it can be read by a
        simple FITS or ASCII reader.  The format will be determined from the file extension.
